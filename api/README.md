# Working on the go-api-skeleton API

The go-api-skeleton consists of various components in this repository:

- `api/swagger.yaml` A Swagger definition of the API.
- `api/types/` Types shared by both the client and server, representing various objects, options, responses, etc. Most are written manually, but some are automatically generated from the Swagger definition. 

## Swagger definition

The API is defined by the [Swagger](http://swagger.io/specification/) definition in `api/swagger.yaml`. This definition can be used to:

1. Automatically generate documentation.
2. Automatically generate the Go server and client. (A work-in-progress.)
3. Provide a machine readable version of the API for introspecting what it can do, automatically generating clients for other languages, etc.

## Updating the API documentation

The API documentation is generated entirely from `api/swagger.yaml`. If you make updates to the API, edit this file to represent the change in the documentation.

## Viewing the API documentation

When you make edits to `swagger.yaml`, you may want to check the generated API documentation to ensure it renders correctly.
